# Image-Classifier-Deep-Learning

Used TensorFlow with Keras to classify images obtained from a Fashion-MNIST dataset by Zalando a fashion company based in Berlin. This project's purpose was to utilize Tensorflow and Keras to classify various types of clothing articles from the images. With a complex sequential model with multiple convolution layers and retraining the model with Dropout layers to reduce overfitting I obtained an accuracy ~0.93 for test prediction.
